# The Lions of Al Rassan

*Inspired by the novel by Guy Gavriel Kay*

---

## Setting

Al Rassan is a peninsula where three faiths have coexisted for three hundred years — sometimes in peace, sometimes in war, always in tension. The great Caliphate that once unified the south has crumbled into competing kingdoms. The Jaddite kingdoms of the north press southward in the name of their god. And across the sea, a new and harder faith is gathering its strength.

This is the last golden age of Al Rassan. It is already ending.

## Civilizations

### Kingdom of Ragosa (Asharite)
**Color:** Gold — **Advantage:** Trade & Culture

The most cultured of the Asharite kingdoms. Ragosa starts wealthy and at peace, with high dinars and faith. It is the civilization of scholars, physicians, and poets. Its libraries and observatories are the finest on the peninsula.

- **Starting advantage:** High dinars, trade_goods, and faith. Starts with Trade Networks and Patronage of the Arts.
- **Playstyle:** Economic and cultural. Win through the Faith accumulation victory or build toward The Golden Age tech path.
- **Weakness:** Low military. Ragosa must buy protection or build it slowly.

### Emirate of Cartada (Asharite)
**Color:** Deep Red — **Advantage:** Military & Expansion

The sword of the Asharite south. Cartada's armies are the most feared on the peninsula. It starts with the most soldiers and the most aggressive units.

- **Starting advantage:** High soldiers and horses. Starts with Levy Infantry and Horsemanship.
- **Playstyle:** Aggressive expansion. Use early military advantage to seize territory before enemies can tech up. Contest Qurtaba immediately.
- **Weakness:** Low dinars and faith. Extended wars drain Cartada faster than it can replenish.

### Kingdom of Valledo (Jaddite)
**Color:** Dark Blue — **Advantage:** Faith & Cavalry

The premier Jaddite military power. Valledo burns with religious purpose and has the cavalry to act on it. Its knights are the best on the peninsula when morale is high.

- **Starting advantage:** High faith and soldiers. Starts with Levy Infantry, Horsemanship, and Patronage of the Arts.
- **Playstyle:** Balanced military with a religious edge. The Reconquista tech path reduces the hex-control victory threshold — Valledo can win by expanding into Asharite territory with a purpose.
- **Weakness:** Moderate economy. Valledo needs trade to fuel long campaigns.

### Kingdom of Ruenda (Jaddite)
**Color:** Purple — **Advantage:** Horses & Sea Trade

The eastern Jaddite kingdom sits astride the coastal road and grows rich from it. Ruenda has the best cavalry breeding and the most natural access to sea trade.

- **Starting advantage:** Very high horses, good trade_goods. Starts with Trade Networks and Horsemanship.
- **Playstyle:** Economic-military hybrid. Build ports and stables early. The war-galley gives Ruenda unique coastal power. Allied with Valledo at game start — use this.
- **Weakness:** Needs investment to realize its advantages. Low soldiers at start means vulnerability to early aggression.

### The Kindath
**Color:** Silver — **Advantage:** Commerce & Diplomacy

The silver-robed wanderers have no kingdom, only a quarter in every city. They are the richest civilization per resource point but have almost no military. They survive through trade, alliance, and making themselves indispensable.

- **Starting advantage:** Very high dinars and trade_goods. Starts with Trade Networks. Unique Kindath Counting House building.
- **Playstyle:** Pure economic and diplomatic. The Kindath cannot win militarily. Win through the Faith accumulation victory (if well-protected), or become a vassal to a powerful neighbor and share in their victory. The Kindath Alliance tech makes Kindath vassalage uniquely rewarding for the host civ.
- **Weakness:** Almost no soldiers. The Kindath are immediately vulnerable to anyone who decides tolerance is expensive.

## The Seasonal Cycle

The game runs in Seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter. Each Season has modifiers:

| Season | Notable Effects |
|--------|----------------|
| **Spring** | Grain +20%, Horses +10%, Stability +3. Best for rebuilding. |
| **Summer** | Soldiers +10%, Dinars +10%, Combat +5. Campaign season. |
| **Autumn** | Grain +30%, Trade Goods +15%, Stability +2. Harvest time. |
| **Winter** | Grain -25%, Soldiers -10%, Combat -5, Stability -5. Survive. |

## The Tension Axes

### Religious Fervor (0–100)
Rises when holy wars are declared, religious techs are researched, and faith-based events occur. High Religious Fervor gives combat bonuses against opponents of the opposing religion — but triggers persecution events against the Kindath and reduces diplomatic options between faiths.

### The Muwardi Threat (0–100)
A global clock. The Muwardi Threat rises each Season, faster when the Asharite kingdoms are divided or weakened. When it reaches 50, scouts begin reporting Muwardi vanguards. At 70, the army lands. At 90, the last battle begins.

All civilizations share this threat level. Keeping the Asharite kingdoms strong — even for Jaddite players who might prefer them weak — delays the invasion. A peninsula consumed by internal war will fall to the Muwardis regardless of who holds the most hexes.

## The Tech Tree

Three eras of technology, each requiring the previous era's foundations:

- **The Fragile Peace** (Era 1): Basic military, economy, and cultural foundations.
- **The Unraveling** (Era 2): Professional armies, religious zeal, spice trade, and the beginning of siege warfare.
- **The Last Light** (Era 3): Holy war, golden age, grand coalition, the reconquista — and the last defenses against what is coming.

Key late-game techs:
- **The Golden Age** — requires Astronomy + Spice Trade + Patronage. Massive faith and dinars bonus; enables cultural victory.
- **The Poet-Kings** — requires Golden Age + Astronomy. The apex of Asharite culture. *Triggers the "A Golden Age Ends" event and accelerates Muwardi Threat.*
- **The Reconquista** — requires Holy War + Cavalry Tactics. Reduces the hex-control victory count by 20%.
- **Grand Coalition** — allows forming alliances with sworn enemies when the threat demands it.

## Notes for New Players

- **The Kindath are not for beginners.** Playing them requires understanding the diplomatic system deeply. They are rewarding for experienced players.
- **Winter is dangerous.** Keep grain reserves above 15 entering winter, or accept stability penalties.
- **Qurtaba is contested.** The ruined former capital has no owner at game start. It is worth taking — and worth fighting over.
- **The Muwardi Threat rises automatically.** Even if no player takes the Muwardi-themed events, the threat ticks upward. The invasion is not if, it is when.
